**Slide Title Suggestion:** Reinforcement Learning for LEO Satellite Frequency Allocation

---

**Content for Slide Body:**

**1. The Goal: Maximize Network Performance**

Our Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent aims to learn the best strategy to allocate frequencies to LEO satellites. The objective is to maximize the total expected signal quality over time.

**2. Core RL Components:**

* **State ($S_t$): What the agent observes**
    * $S_t = \{ \text{utc\_timestamp}_t, F_{\text{leo\_connecting}, t} \}$
    * *Where:*
        * $\text{utc\_timestamp}_t$: Current universal time.
        * $F_{\text{leo\_connecting}, t}$: Frequencies of LEO satellites currently connecting to the user.

* **Action ($A_t$): What the agent decides**
    * $A_t = \{ f_{\text{leo\_allocate}, t} \}$
    * *Where:*
        * $f_{\text{leo\_allocate}, t}$: The specific frequencies chosen from available options to allocate to LEO satellites.

* **Reward ($R_{t+1}$): Feedback on the agent's action**
    * $R_{t+1} = \sum \text{SINR}(\text{LEO}_{\text{active}, t+1}) + \sum \text{SINR}(\text{GEO}_{\text{active}, t+1})$
    * *This means the reward is the sum of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratios for all LEO and GEO satellites actively providing service after the allocation.*

**3. The Learning Objective (Formula):**

Find an optimal policy $\pi^*$ to maximize the expected discounted cumulative reward:

$$J(\pi) = E \left[ \sum_{k=0}^{T} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1} \middle| S_t, A_t \sim \pi(S_t) \right]$$

* **$\pi^*$**: The optimal strategy (policy).
* **$E[\cdot]$**: Expected value (average outcome).
* **$\sum_{k=0}^{T}$**: Sum over time steps from now ($t$) up to a horizon $T$.
* **$\gamma^k$**: Discount factor ($0 \le \gamma \le 1$); values future rewards slightly less than immediate ones.
* **$R_{t+k+1}$**: Reward received at a future step.

**Tips for PowerPoint Presentation:**

1.  **Use a "Title and Content" or "Two Content" Layout:** This will give you space for a title and then to break down the components.
2.  **Introduce Each Component Clearly:** You can use bullet points as above for State, Action, and Reward.
3.  **The Formula:**
    * You can type this directly into a PowerPoint text box.
    * For better formatting of the mathematical formula, use PowerPoint's **Equation Editor**:
        * Go to the "Insert" tab.
        * Click on "Equation" (usually a $\pi$ symbol).
        * You can then type or build the formula using the equation tools. This will make it look much cleaner and more professional.
4.  **Use Animation (Sparingly):** You could have each component (State, Action, Reward, then the Formula) appear one by one on a click to help guide your audience.
5.  **Explain in Simple Terms:** After showing the formula, reiterate what each part means in the context of your LEO satellite system, as done in the "Explanation for PowerPoint" section in my previous response.
6.  **Visuals:** If possible, add a simple diagram illustrating a user, LEO satellites, GEO satellites, and frequency bands to make the concept more tangible.

Good luck with your presentation!
